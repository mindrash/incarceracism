# Incarceracism
Incarceracism is a data influenced view of the 70% racial minorities incarceration percentage based on the [Prisoners in 2020 - Statistical Tables NCJ 302776](https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2020-statistical-tables) report provided by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

## Description
In my life I have learned that words may not be as impactful as data. In this situation I don't feel I have many more words I could add to frame the thoughts and discussions that this data should call forth and draw out. I can provide a vehicle for the data to be looked at in another way. That is what I am hoping the Incarceracism art and NFT lends to facilitate change. The colors of the art are directly influenced in the programming logic that produces them to be at least 70% racially symbolic. The imagery is meant to be straightforward, but I hope someone can appreciate them in a way that one may be displayed and cause someone to pause, think, and act.

There are a total of 3,000 pieces in the series, but will be distributed across multiple chains to spread the idea as far and wide as possible. Most of the series will be free mint except to provide a few examples to demonstrate. On Polygon 1,000 of them will be minted to demonstrate the series and to be held by the creator for yet to be determined future allocation. See below for how they are distributed.

| chain | series     | amount                                          |
|-------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ethereum (ETH) | #1 - 100 | 100 - 3 minted, 97 free mint |
| Tezos (XTZ) | #101 - 200 | 100 minted |
| Polygon (MATIC) | #201 - 2,900 | 1000 allocated to creator, 1700 free mint |
| Fantom (FTM) | #2,901 - 3,000 | 100 - 3 minted, 97 free mint |

The art is deceptively simple or I guess I should just say - this art took a long time to process. The handcuff placement is the most expensive part of the process for each piece. The program wants to find a good available location to put the handcuff so that it looks correct. That process can take some time and it will eventually give up after 1,000 tries.

The process took almost <strong>12.5 hours to create 3,000 pieces</strong>. Below is a log snippet:
